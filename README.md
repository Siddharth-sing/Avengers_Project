# Avengers_Project
This is a basic app. 
I have used shared preferences in this to store login credentials and I also implemented the logout button. 
Since it is a multiscreen app so I also used 'Intent()' class in this project. 
'setOnClickListener' is obviously used because I have implemented login and logout buttons. 

/* For Login put "9119148863" in number column and any of these "Hulk, Tony, Steve, Natasha, Thanos" passwords to login. */
